## Method 1 - automatically finding multiple devices and starting them
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     import time

#     board_id_cyton = BoardIds.CYTON_BOARD.value

#     # Instantiate BrainFlowBoardSetup for the first board with verbose=False to suppress logs
#     brainflow_setup_1 = BrainFlowBoardSetup(board_id=board_id_cyton)

#     # Instantiate BrainFlowBoardSetup for the second board with verbose=True for detailed output
#     brainflow_setup_2 = BrainFlowBoardSetup(board_id=board_id_cyton)

#     # Set up the first board and start streaming
#     brainflow_setup_1.setup()

#     # Set up the second board and start streaming (with detailed logs)
#     brainflow_setup_2.setup()

#     # Stream for 5 seconds
#     time.sleep(5)

#     # Retrieve and print data from the first board
#     data_1 = brainflow_setup_1.get_board_data()
#     print(f"Data from board 1: {data_1}")

#     # Retrieve and print data from the second board
#     data_2 = brainflow_setup_2.get_board_data()
#     print(f"Data from board 2: {data_2}")

#     # Stop streaming and release both boards
#     brainflow_setup_1.stop()
#     brainflow_setup_2.stop()

## Method 2 - Detecting compatible devices and assigning them consistently -> ideal for ensuring the same board is assigned to the same port on each run
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     import time

#     board_id_cyton = BoardIds.CYTON_BOARD.value

#     # Instantiate BrainFlowBoardSetup with verbose enabled for detailed output
#     brainflow_setup_detector = BrainFlowBoardSetup(board_id=board_id_cyton)

#     # Find all compatible devices
#     compatible_ports = brainflow_setup_detector.find_device_ports()

#     # Check if at least two devices are found
#     if len(compatible_ports) >= 2:
#         serial_port_1 = compatible_ports[0]['port']
#         serial_port_2 = compatible_ports[1]['port']

#         # Instantiate BrainFlowBoardSetup for the first board
#         brainflow_setup_1 = BrainFlowBoardSetup(board_id=board_id_cyton, serial_port=serial_port_1)

#         # Instantiate BrainFlowBoardSetup for the second board
#         brainflow_setup_2 = BrainFlowBoardSetup(board_id=board_id_cyton, serial_port=serial_port_2)

#         # Set up the first board and start streaming
#         brainflow_setup_1.setup()

#         # Set up the second board and start streaming
#         brainflow_setup_2.setup()

#         # Stream from both boards for 5 seconds
#         time.sleep(5)

#         # Retrieve and print data from the first board
#         data_1 = brainflow_setup_1.get_board_data()
#         print(f"Data from board 1: {data_1}")

#         # Retrieve and print data from the second board
#         data_2 = brainflow_setup_2.get_board_data()
#         print(f"Data from board 2: {data_2}")

#         # Stop the streaming and release the sessions for both boards
#         brainflow_setup_1.stop()
#         brainflow_setup_2.stop()

#     else:
#         print("Not enough compatible devices found.")
